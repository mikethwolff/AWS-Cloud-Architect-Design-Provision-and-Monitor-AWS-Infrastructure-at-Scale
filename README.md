# Project 2: Design, Provision and Monito AWS Infrastructure at Scale

In this project, you will plan, design, provision, and monitor infrastructure in AWS using industry-standard and open source tools. You will practice the skills you have learned throughout the course to optimize infrastructure for cost and performance. You will also use Terraform to provision and configure AWS services in a global configuration.

**Task 1: Create AWS Architecture Schematics**

**Part 1**
You have been asked to plan and provision a cost-effective AWS infrastructure for a new social media application development project for 50,000 single-region users. The project requires the following AWS infrastructure and services. Please include your name and label all elements of the infrastructure on the diagram.

- Infrastructure in the following regions: us-east-1
- Users and Client machines
- One VPC
- Two Availability Zones
- Four Subnets (2 Public, 2 Private)
- A NAT Gateway
- A CloudFront distribution with an S3 bucket
- Web servers in the Public Subnets sized according to your usage estimates
- Application Servers in the Private Subnets sized according to your usage estimates
- DB Servers in the Private Subnets
- Web Servers Load Balanced and Autoscaled
- Application Servers Load Balanced and Autoscaled
- A Master DB in AZ1 with a read replica in AZ2
- Use LucidChart or a similar diagramming application to create your schematic. 
Export your schematic as a PDF and save as Udacity_Diagram_1.pdf.
